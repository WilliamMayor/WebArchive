select everything
    - reverse traditional selection/collection
    - select from the archive after (perhaps long after) the collection has happened

shingles
    - minor differences in pages
    - over time, might change by small amount
    - ignore the small change?
    - compress the changes as deltas?

how to collect everything
    - random sample?
        - how hard?
        - Valerie King (how to randomly sample the web)
        - David Gelerntner (??) - Yale - timestream
    - random seeds
        - what effect can bad seeds have?
        - how large the expected collection given seeds?
    - how frequently do pages change?
    - what's the ratio between crawling old pages (for changes) and crawling new?
    - Brewster Khale
        - what papers has he written
    - Shi Zhou
        - has done work on Internet network topology
